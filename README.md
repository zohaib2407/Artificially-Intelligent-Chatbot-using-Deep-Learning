# Artificially-Intelligent-Chatbot-using-Deep-Learning

## Objective
We built two different chatbots that will simulate human conversation through texts. We have explored two broader categories of chatbots:

#### Scripted chatbot
The chatbot will be trained on an existing dataset using a neural network model and once deployed, it will respond to the posed questions with the pre-determined scripts that are created and stored in their library. In general, these are simple chatbots that highly depend on user input. If customer queries fall outside the pre-defined rules, these chatbots fall short of recognizing conversation context and won’t be able to identify advanced scenarios.

#### Artificially Intelligent Chatbot
Artificial intelligence chatbots, on the other hand, use natural language processing (NLP) and Deep Neural Networks to understand the intent behind the question and solve the customer’s problem without any human assistance. The chatbot is trained on an existing dataset using seq-to-seq/BERT model and for the posed questions it will generate new answers (that are not there in answer corpus) based on the index of the vocabulary that it is trained on. The bot tries to mimic human-like traits and responses.
